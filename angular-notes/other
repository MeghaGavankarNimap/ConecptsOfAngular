if reponse data is in object or we want to console the data then console,log(dta) will give [object object]bcoz js conver js tring to string which gives this obj obj.so i we wan to console object then used JSON.stringify(dta) to convert js objct to json string.

child
@output(data)eventEmitter<any>=new eventEmitter()


data.emit(val)

parent
<app-child (data)=fun($event)></>

fun(val){
    final=this.value
}



Datasources
matHeaderCellDef and matCellDef Directives are structural directives used.
they are used to define just their role.
object in each row is accessible via the let variable syntax.


to pass data throufh URL:
types of route paramter
query parameters: if you are using query paramter then no neet to define in routing file.
and to access data key value pair use router.queeyparam.subscribe.
path?and key-value will get separated by &


required and optional paramter:
  this.router.navigate(['/user', userId, { name: userName }])

  here userid is required and name is optional(as it is key value pair).

  SO IN ROUTING FILE IF I DONT WRITE name then also will not give any error becoz it is optional.but id is required .




navigation extras:
Data stored in state will not expose in url.
just have to add navigation extra object containing state onjet and in that required value.then this.route.navigate([],{navgatioextras oject})

dont write in routing file anything.no need.

in html access that state using activated route like route.quryparam(data)




gaurds:
difference in canactivate and canload is that in can load module is not loaded 1st but in can activate module is loaded 1st whether t will go to requested route or not.


select option dropdoen:
when any option get selected then value property of that select option will goes into the formcontrol.
so if value property is dynamic then use property binding [value]="item.id" like this to get the value in value atribute of option.

angular ts file:
we write parivate instance:imported service etc which in constructor of class so that we can access that instance within a class.
When you declare a property in the constructor with the private keyword, it does become a class property, and it's accessible throughout the class, not just within the constructor.

node.js app install then it includes node runtime env,npm.
devDependencies:
Include tools and libraries that are necessary for development but not needed for the production runtime.

changeDetectionstrategy :it is used to deetct chnages automatically that it tell how chage deatction should occur in angular.
it contain onPush and default.
ChangeDetectionStrategy is an attribute of the @Component decorator in Angular, and it defines how change detection should be performed for a specific component.

ChangeDetectionRef:it is used to deetct chnages manually
detectchange , markforcheck
ChangeDetectorRef is a service in Angular that provides methods to manually trigger change detection for a component and its children.
OnPush means that the change detection will only occur if the component's input properties change or if an event is triggered from within the component.
Default means that the change detection will run whenever there is any change in the application, including changes in the component's own state.



session,local storage and cookies:
sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends. that is tab of a browser is closed .


Local storage has 4 methods:

setItem() Method – This method takes two parameters one is key and another one is value. It is used to store the value in a particular location with the name of the key.
localStorage.setItem(key, value)
getItem() Method – This method takes one parameter that is key which is used to get the value stored with a particular key name.
localStorage.getItem(key)
removeItem() Method – This is method is used to remove the value stored in the memory in reference to key.
localStorage.removeItem(key)
clear() Method – This method is used to clear all the values stored in localstorage.

localstorage:
When a user closes the tab or window, the data stored in localStorage will not be automatically removed.


Angular decorators:
Decorators are design patterns used to isolate the modification or decoration of a class without modifying the source code.
