if reponse data is in object or we want to console the data then console,log(dta) will give [object object]bcoz js conver js tring to string which gives this obj obj.so i we wan to console object then used JSON.stringify(dta) to convert js objct to json string.

child
@output(data)eventEmitter<any>=new eventEmitter()


data.emit(val)

parent
<app-child (data)=fun($event)></>

fun(val){
    final=this.value
}



Datasources
matHeaderCellDef and matCellDef Directives are structural directives used.
they are used to define just their role.
object in each row is accessible via the let variable syntax.


to pass data throufh URL:
types of route paramter
query parameters: if you are using query paramter then no neet to define in routing file.
and to access data key value pair use router.queeyparam.subscribe.
path?and key-value will get separated by &


required and optional paramter:
  this.router.navigate(['/user', userId, { name: userName }])

  here userid is required and name is optional(as it is key value pair).

  SO IN ROUTING FILE IF I DONT WRITE name then also will not give any error becoz it is optional.but id is required .




navigation extras:
Data stored in state will not expose in url.
just have to add navigation extra object containing state onjet and in that required value.then this.route.navigate([],{navgatioextras oject})

dont write in routing file anything.no need.

in html access that state using activated route like route.quryparam(data)
